        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Obatola Opeyemi, and I come from a family of five, where I
          am the eldest of three siblings. I am 26 years old and studied
          Transport Planning and Management at Olabisi Onabanjo University.
        </p>
        <p>
          I earned my bachelor's degree in 2022 and then completed my National
          Youth Service in 2024. During my service year, I was deployed to Ogun
          State, where, after my orientation program, I was posted to Christ's
          Mercy Comprehensive College in Oke-Saje for my primary assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          While serving, I joined the Nigeria Red Cross Society at the
          Abeokuta-North branch, where I took on the role of Public Relations
          Officer. I participated in several public speaking engagements during
          this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also held leadership positions as the president of the Winners'
          Youth Corpers Lodge and the Winners' Youth Corpers Fellowship (WYCF).
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I work as a Sales Executive at Zedvance Finance. I joined
          the company as a graduate trainee and am also enrolled at Altschool
          Africa's School of Engineering, which I am funding myself.
